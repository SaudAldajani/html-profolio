    <h1>The Best Movies According to Saud</h1>
    <h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Whiplash</h3>
    <p>
        "Whiplash" is cinematic adrenalin. In an era when so many films feel more refined by focus groups or marketing managers,
        it is a deeply personal and vibrantly alive drama. 
        Damien Chazelle has taken a relatively staid subject like 
        the relationship between a music student and his teacher and turned it into a thriller built on a brilliant undercurrent of social commentary about what it takes to make it in an increasingly competitive and cutthroat world.

    <h3>Fight Club</h3>
    <p>
        "Fight Club" is the most frankly and cheerfully fascist big-star movie since "Death Wish,"
        a celebration of violence in which the heroes write themselves a license to drink,
        smoke, screw and beat one another up.

    <h3>interstellar</h3>
    <p>
        Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction drama film directed by Christopher Nolan,
        who co-wrote it with his brother Jonathan. It stars Matthew McConaughey,
        Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, Michael Caine,
        and Matt Damon. Set in a dystopian future where Earth is suffering from catastrophic blight and famine,
        the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for humankind.
